\subsection{Outline of research strategy and applied methods}

% Diese Abschnitt muss ersetzt werden mit der von uns gewählten Vorgehensweise

In the last section we described the advantages and drawback of tax-data discussing five aspects, which we regard as crucial concerning the assessment of inequality. To get a feeling of the importance of these aspects, we exploit the FTA-tax data as far as possible and perform several insightful calculations addressing four of the five mentioned aspects. No further investigation is possible regarding aspect (1) concepts on measuring economic resource. But for the other four thematic areas, we can provide deeper insight. In general our main strategy is to apply different possible concepts within one conceptional area (income, units, measurement, population coverage) while holding other conceptual differences constant. With this strategy we want to show, the sensitiveness the assessment of inequality is especially if one looks at time trends.\\

To fulfill the above described task, we use two techniques. To assess the development over time, we calculate in general gini-coefficients for all possible time points, allowing us the make time trends visible and to compare the result out of the FTA-tax data to other publications. For selected periods we expand the analysis with relative distribution methods, which allows an in-depth analysis of distributional differences and therefore catches the shortcomings of gini-coefficients. \\

To calculate Gini-coefficients we follow common definitions, like it is described for example in \citep{jann_einfuhrung_2005}. Because the relative distribution methods are not that widely know, we provide a short introduction of the important concepts in this section. We additional expand the method section with an extended analysis about the importance of non-taxed, because the issue of non-taxed is a especially thorny one.


\subsubsection{Relative distribution (RD) framework}

The RD-framework is based on the concept of a ``relative distribution'', a transformation of the data from two distributions into a single distribution that contains all of the information necessary for scale-invariant comparison. This allows to make distribution differences ``visual'' in an elegant way and it is also a base for summary statistics, which are more sensitive to detailed theoretical hypotheses in contrast to other measures like the gini-coefficient or top income-shares, which inform either about the whole population or only about the top part of the distribution.\\

% Probability Density function as a base for the RD
The goal of RD is to study the differences between two distributions. A common example could be the income distribution for man and women. Subject of the comparison can also be two distributions describing the same population, but stemming from two different data sources like survey or tax data or even comparison of the same source/population but for different time points, like the income distribution out of tax data for Switzerland today compared to an earlier time point. To describe how the two distributions are gone be transformed into a relative distribution, we start with defining the two distributions. One represents the reference population $Y_{0}$ and the other the comparison population $Y$. $x$ represents our measure of interest (income). A first visual approach is to compare the two probability density functions (PDF). The PDF is a function $f(x)$ which describes the distribution of probability over the outcome set and is defined for all possible values of $x$. Also this function integrates to 1, which means that the sum of all probabilities over all possible values is 100\%. Out of the comparison of the PDF, it is possible to see, which values of $x$ are more and less probable. This allows already to spot distributional differences over the whole scale of $Y$ visually. \\

The PDF can be characterized by its cumulative distribution function (CDF). The CDF can be formulated as $F(y)$, which represents the cumulative probability at point $x$, which is the probability that a randomly chosen value is less than or equal to $x$. The relative distribution of $Y$ to $Y_{0}$ is then defined as 

\begin{equation}
R=F_{0}(Y)
\end{equation}

R is obtained from $Y$ by transforming it by the CDF for $Y_{0}$, $\F_{0}$. $R$ therefore measures the relative rank of $Y$ compared to $Y_{0}$. 

% Relative Distribution


\begin{equation}
g(r)=\frac{f(F_{0}^{-1}(r))}{^{f_{0}(F_{0}^{-1}(r))}}
\end{equation}


We can calculate the Probability Density Function $g(r)$ of R, where $r$ represents the proportion of values and $F_{0}^{-1}(r)$ is the inverse cumulative distribution function, also called the quantile function. $g(r)$ can be interpreted as a density ratio, which is defined as the ratio of these two quantities evaluated at every percentile of the reference distribution [0,1]. With a complete overlap of both distributions the probability density function of the R is 1 at every point of the PDF. On the other hand, values higher than 1 represent higher probabilities in the comparison distribution than in the references distribution at this specific point and values lower than 1 respectively represent lower probabilities. It is a proper PDF in the sense that it integrates to 1 over the unit interval.\\

% Median and shape differences
What we get through the above transformation of two distributions is the overall relative probability density. But differences between distributions can be divided into two basic components: changes in location and changes in shape. If the comparative distribution is a simple location-shifted version of the reference distribution, then the difference between the two distributions can be parsimoniously summarized by this shift. Differences that remain after a location adjustment are differences in ``shape'' (scale, skewness and other distributional characteristics). When both types of shifts are operating, or when factors other than scale are changing in the shape component, we need a way to separate out the various effects. If we want to identify the effect of a location shift and separate it from other changes in the distribution, it is necessary to specify what scale this shift operates on. It is possible to adjust distributions by any measure of central tendency. Here we choose a median location adjustment because the median is a natural, robust and scale invariant unit of measurement. Because our interest lies in analyzing distributional differences concerning the degree of inequality, we will focus in the results section on shape differences and look therefore at the relative distribution after the distributions are adjusted for location differences. 

% R based Summary Meausres
Distributional polarization is of particular interest in the study of inequality. However, common inequality indicators (for example Gini or Theil’s index) are not designed to distinguish between growth in the upper and lower tails. Even if the measures register increasing inequality over time, one cannot distinguish a polarization of the distribution (increases in both tails) from upgrading (increases in the upper tail) or downgrading (increases in lower tail). The polarization index plays the same role as the difference in Gini-indices, but it can be decomposed to compare the growth in the upper and lower tails. Because it is based on the relative distribution it provides a simple link between what is observed in the graphical display and what is measured by the numerical summary. \\

The median relative polarization index (MRP) is then the mean absolute deviation around the median of the location-adjusted relative distribution, scaled to produce an index that varies between -1 and 1. Given the scaling, a value of zero represents no differences in distributional shape; positive values represent more polarization (increases in the tails of the distribution); and negative values represent less polarization (convergence towards the center of the distribution). The measure catches only differences in distributional shape (not location). And it has several interesting features. MRP can be interpreted in terms of a proportional shift of mass in the distribution from more central to less central values. A value of 0.1, for example, is equivalent to a 10\% population shift from the center of the distribution to the upper and lower quartiles and the MRP is decomposable along the scale of $y$. This makes it possible to compare the contribution of each section of the distribution to the overall polarization. A natural decomposition is the contributions made by components above and below the median (of $g(r)$).

%\textbf{Incomplete coverage of the population (left censored data.)} What can be done about the not-taxed? \citet{dell_income_2007} impute for non-fillers the 20 percentage of the annual average income. This flattens the distribution on the left side, which is not a problem if you are interested in the top income shares, but it would surly affect overall measures of inequality. Furthermore the authors calculate the proportion of non-fillers by estimating the total of tax units out of the population records. \\

%\textbf{changes in taxation system  (switch from annual to biannual taxation)} In the mid-1990s a fundamental change in the Swiss tax system took place by switching form the two-years based praenumerando taxation to the one-year based postnumerando taxation. This change was enacted with a transitional period of several years, during which each canton could choose when to adopt the new system.  This is why during the transitional period from 1995 to 2003 there is no uniform tax data published on the Swiss level but only data on the cantonal level \citep[8f]{foellmi_volatile_2013}. \\

%Studies on income try to focus on the disposable income, which subtracts certain expenditures from the primary income. Deductions reflect somehow compulsory expenditures and thus taxable income can be seen as a sort of pseudo disposable income. On the other hand deductions can affect the distribution. There are recent studies about the correlation of progressivity and deductions in Switzerland, which examines if deductions have a ``perverse redistribution'' effect by redistributing income from the lower middle class to the upper middle class (see \citealt{peters_steuerabzuge:_2011} and \citet{Interpellation Barbara Gysel (2009) FEHLT. das interpellation barbara sieht falsch aus}.

%\subsection{Hypotheses}
%Based on the theories we test the following hypotheses:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item H1: Develpment of inequality is driven by sectoral change
%\item H2: Development of inequality is driven by political change, i.e. economic crisis contribute to inequality because welfare states tend to be downsized
%\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Data and Variables}

%We use data from the Swiss Federat Tax Administration (FTA) where our data about incomes ranges from the years 1941/42 to 2010. While the data results in a long and consistent time series to illustrate swiss inequality development, there are a few pitfalls we want to adress which might be of interest for other research on this topic (be it in Switzerland or other countries).

%\subsubsection{Left censored data}

%The FTA provides data about all tax units in Switzerland that are liable to pay federal taxes.A tax unit may be a single person or a household. The taxable population however is not identical to the population which should be used to calculate measures of inequality. Precisely, the data do not contain tax units with very little incomes so calculations based on these data treat the lowest percentiles equally to tax units with zero income.Figure X shows the threshold to be hit to enter the statistic.

%\textcolor{red}{[FIGURE X ABOUT HERE] soll zeigen: Zeitreihe der Untergrenze von 1941-2010}

%So first of all, there is a bias in the level of an inequality measure one could calculate with the   FTA data. Furthermore, also the changes over time might not be interpreted savely as over time the number of tax unit within this "hidden range" might vary or might even have a certain trend. We will adress this issue in detail in the methods chapter.

%\subsubsection{Different measures, different populations}

%The FTA data makes two kinds of distinctions. First, data was collected for so called "normal cases" and "special cases", i.e. a "normal case" is a taxable (for the complete tax period) person or household domiciled in a swiss canton without income from outside of Switzerland. A "special case" therefore is a diffuse reference category that contains tax units that are taxed at source, were not taxable for the complete tax period or generated additional income in another country. Second, the FTA reports two measures, that is taxable income and absolute income \textcolor{red}{(meine vorläufige Übersetzung von Reineinkommen)}. Absolute income is the sum of all incomes (earnings, interest income, rental incomes) minus expenses (e.g. from self-employment or credit cost). The taxable income is calculated as the difference of absolute income and deductions (e.g. children, insurance rates). The longest consistent time series exists for the taxable income of normal cases. So all statements we make with our data only apply to this subpopulation.

%\subsubsection{Changes in taxation and measurement}
%The swiss tax system is highly federal. That means, communities raise taxes which then go to the communities, the canton and the state. If we want to calculate overall swiss measures, we need to take into account, that cantons vary (between cantons and over time) with regard to the tax deductions that are possible and also the mechanism how taxes are collected. The latter adresses a comprehensive reorganization of the swiss tax system where between 1995 and 2003 cantons changed from taxing the past two years of income (postnumerando system) to taxing the present single year (praenumerando system). For details see \textcolor{red}{Martinez (xxxx) or some other author (xxxx)}. Aggregate measures of inequality therefore have to be estimated for the periods 1995 to 2003 which we adress shortly in the methods chapter.

%\subsection{Methodology Used}
%There are two steps of data analyses which need to be described to the reader. First, the estimation of the bias we introduce by estimating measures of inequality when tax units with too little income are not observed. Second, the steps undertaken to estimate aggregate swiss measures by imputing taxable income for those cantons and periods where the change of the tax system produced a gap (1995 to 2003, depending on the canton). 

%\subsubsection{Imputing the gap}
%The imputation is not a focus of the paper so we basically follow the most simple approach of Martinez (xxxx). That is estimating the missing taxable income statistics via OLS using information from time trends and cantons. Our imputation model therefore includes canton inequality measures and periods dummies to explain aggregate swiss inequality.

\subsubsection{Non-taxed}
Some tax units are missing in the FTA data as they do not qualify for taxation below a certain income threshold. The income distribution is therefore cut at the left end. For most of the observed range it is not documented how many tax units fall into this unobserved category. Since 1995 however the FTA provides the number of people not being taxed (we will call these tax units ``zeros''). From 1995 to 2010 we can therefore estimate the bias we introduce when ignoring the zeros. In this section we will try to analyze whether the bias is stable over time (and cantons). If the bias was stable over time, we could still analyze trends and changes of inequality no matter how severe the bias is. 

First it is useful to look at the descriptives plotting the share of zeros over time.

<<setup>>=
library(foreign)
df <- read.csv("../../data/ginis_und_perzentile_normal.csv",sep="\t")
df$zeros <- df$null_norm/df$cpop # i only use normal cases here
@

<<zero_descriptives, fig.cap='',fig.pos='H'>>=
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df[df$steuerperiode>=1995&df$kanton=="CH",], aes(x=steuerperiode,y=zeros))+geom_line()+theme_bw()+xlab("tax period")+ylab("share of non-taxed")
#ggplot(df[df$steuerperiode>=1995,], aes(x=steuerperiode,y=zeros))+geom_line()+facet_wrap(~kanton)+geom_line(aes(y=G_steink),color="blue")+theme_bw()
@

The number of zeros increased slightly according to figure \ref{fig:zero_descriptives}. Different interpretations seems possible. The increased share of zeros could be driven by the FTA's inflation adjustments or an increase in social deductions. Another plausible explanation is the increasing number of unmarried couples filling in two separate tax forms instead of one so we observe two ``small'' incomes instead of one ``large'' income, thus inflating the number of people falling below the taxation threshold. 

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item There is a small overall upward trend which we assume to be the Federal Administrations inflation adjustments to the tax threshold.
%\item Geneva and Tessin show wild changes but those might be explained by the tax gap ("Bemessungslücke") that people exploited when the cantons changed the tax system. It %remains unclear however why we can't see similar patter within other cantons.
%\item There is some variance and we see different patterns over time and cantons. When estimating Gini coefficients or the like we must therefore assume that ignoring ``the zeros'' leads to a bias that is not stable over time.
%\end{enumerate}

As we want to report reliably inequality time series we pursue two strategies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add the zeros as a separate group
\item Carry out a statistical test whether the share of zeros alters the Gini coefficient
\end{enumerate}

By adding the zeros back as a separate group we need to make an assumption about the income distribution within that group. We know these cases had incomes between zero and the threshold (usually around 15.000 CHF for the period 1995-2010). In figure \ref{fig:with_without_zeros_Gini} we show Gini coefficients calculated under the assumption of the zeros being zero. This is problematic for two reasons: first we know these units might earn more (up to the threshold) so Ginis calculated on this assumptions will be too high. Second we assume the zero group to be perfectly homogenous which on the contrary has a lowering effect on the Gini coefficient. Therefore we must at least assume a distribution for the zeros that has some variance and ranges from zero to the threshold. We decided to use the most simple approach fulfilling both criteria which is to interpolate a uniform distribution between zero and each tax periods threshold.

The second approach investigates whether the FTA time series is suitable to analyze trends of inequality even if the inequality measures are biased. We can do this by regressing the inequality measure (here the Gini coefficient) on the share of zeros. Simply spoken we test if cutting a larger (left) tail of the distribution changes the shape of the distribution. We include Gini coefficient for all cantons in our analyses to improve the power of our statistical test\footnote{Furthermore without cantonal data (but only data for aggregate Switzerland) it is impossible to distinguish whether inequality changed due to the number of unobserved people or any other variable that changed over time)}.

@

The model outputs a test statistic for each canton that tells us whether the variation of the zero-rate over time leads to a significant deviation from the typical ``canton gini-level''. As the model has a decent fit we are not in great danger of omitted variable bias. Using a joint F-Test we can now test if all canton interactions are zero. 

<<ftest, echo=FALSE>>=
library(survey, quietly=TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
ftest <- regTermTest(fit,"kanton:zeros")
@

In our case we can clearly reject the hypothesis that all interactions are zero ($p=\Sexpr{round(ftest$p,3)}$). This leads to the conclusion that Gini coefficients are biased by the variation of the zero-share. As a minimum a researcher using tax data should therefore control the share of unobserved people, while the best solution is to thoroughly the mechanisms behind a change in the zero share (e.g. this might be due to increased unemployment in one period and due to changes of the tax system in another period.). Fortunately the model coefficient of Switzerland as a whole is not significant suggesting that the cantonal biases cancel each other out. This seems plausible if the phenomenon is e.g. driven by tax competition because most of the ``tax optimization'' happens within Switzerland.
% which is kind of obvious but at the same time we can use the model to report adjusted Gini coefficients. For example one might be interested in how inequality would had developed if the zero-share would have been constant over time. (Note RF: predict all data point using canton, time and the initial OR final zero-share to homogenize the time series)
%Furthermore we can quantify how large the bias is and we can do this separately for tax periods or separately for cantons. 

%For all cantons:

%<<magnitude_of_bias>>=
%reduced_fit <- lm(G_steink~kanton+factor(steuerperiode),data=df)
%#summary(reduced_fit)
%@

%We can see the the model fit reduces to explaining 61.5\% of the Gini variation versus 92.6\% when the information from the zero-shares was used. Although this so some extent attributable to the additional 26 parameters: this is huge. 

%The model indicates some cases that deserve more attention: Schwyz (positive coefficient) and Geneva (negative coefficient) and the tax period 2000 as well as the most recent periods.

Figure \ref{fig:corrected_gini} can be read as follows: A positive coefficient (e.g. Schwyz) states that we measure higher Gini coefficients in periods with many zeros. We can derive, that the distribution of incomes is more skewed for high incomes than for low incomes. Simply speaking, the contrast between low and middle class is less pronounced than the contrast between middle and top class. One possible explanation would be that incomes stem from two different distributions (populations): 1) local people of Schwyz who follow a less skewed distribution and 2) particularly rich people who moved to Schwyz (to avoid taxes). 

A negative coefficient (e.g. Geneva) means the more zeros there are the smaller the Gini measure was compared to other tax periods within that canton (remember this is a fixed-effects model). This is the case we would usually expect: more zeros mask inequality that arises from the bottom.

Another information we can read from the coefficient plot is the (zero-)adjusted inequality development represented by the period dummies. However these values indicate an unweighted change of the Gini coefficient which relates to cantons (not aggregate Switzerland). Fortunately the overall picture of inequality development looks very similar to the plain time series of Gini coefficients. 
%What can we conclude from that analysis? First one must notice that aggregate measure like the Gini (or others) do not always react in the same way when we cut off one part of the distribution, therefore the measures calculated from tax data is biased. On the other hand, the model coefficient of Switzerland as a whole is not significant suggesting that the cantonal biases cancel out each other. This seems plausible. Most of the ``tax optimization'' happens within Switzerland so the rich people who moved to Schwyz are now missing at another canton.

And there is even more to see from the model coefficients: The period-zero-interactions in the model state how an increase of zeros (cutting off a larger piece of the left tail) affects the Gini coefficient in each period compared to 1995. We can see that 2004 to 2010 the (negative) effect is significantly larger than 1995. To simplify: cutting off zeros increasingly leads to an underestimation of inequality measures, probably because the skewness in the left part of the distribution increased. To simplify: in the last decade tax units are increasingly pushed below the observable threshold concealing part of the inequality development. One less dramatic interpretation of this result is the increasing number of unmarried couples filling in two separate tax forms.

%\emph{Defining wealth}
%While the apropiateness of the conceptualization of income is widely discuded, there is no agreed definition of personal wealth yet and the appropriate methods of valuation are not always clear. Wealth can be defined as the marketable value of financial assets plus non-financial assets (housing and land) less debts (Credit Suisse 2011:5).

%The discussion about problems with reporting income is fairly exhaustive. What about wealth?

%It is well recognized that the traditional sources of wealth distribution data are unlikely to provide an accurate picture of wealth ownership in the top-tail of the distribution. \citet{credit_suisse_global_2011} makes use of the information in the ``Rich Lists'' published by Forbes Magazine to adjust the wealth distribution pattern in the highest wealth ranges. \\

%Additionally the Credit Suisse Reports states that these data my be less subject to response bias, but my be more prone to valuation problems, especially in connection with pension assets and debts \citep[8]{credit_suisse_global_2011}.
