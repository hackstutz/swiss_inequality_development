\begin{abstract}

There is empirical evidence that economic inequality increased in the majority of western countries over the last decades (OECD, 2011; Gornick and JÃ¤ntti, 2013). In Switzerland, however, the development is unclear, as there is only little systematic evidence about income inequality that would allow for long-term comparison. Concering the distriubtion of wealth, there is even less information available. Nevertheless income inequality has been a prominent theme in the public discussion in recent years, e.g. the most recent referendums "Abzockerinitiative'' and "1:12-Initiative''. We adress the gap by presenting a long and consistent time series of inequality measures for income and wealth for Switzerland (1943-2010) calculated from federal tax data. We describe the benefits and shortcomings of tax data compared to other data sources and present strategies to handle tax data specific methodological difficulties. In the end we integrate the case of Switzerland into the international picture of inequality development showing parallels and deviations.
